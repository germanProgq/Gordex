# Gordex React App

## Overview
The **Gordex React App** is part of the **Gorder_With_Api** project, which integrates a frontend built with React and a backend API. This application allows users to browse products, manage their cart, and make purchases using various payment methods, including cryptocurrency.

## How to Start

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed for the React frontend.
- Ensure you have **Python 3** and **pip** installed for the backend API.

### Running the Application

#### Frontend (Gordex)
1. Navigate to the **Gordex** folder:
    ```bash
    cd /home/gvino/Desktop/Coding/Projects/Gorder_With_Api/Gordex
    ```

2. Install the necessary npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

#### Backend (API)
1. Navigate to the **API** folder:
    ```bash
    cd /home/gvino/Desktop/Coding/Projects/Gorder_With_Api/api
    ```

2. Check if the virtual environment exists. If it does not, create it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment and install the required packages:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Start the API server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

### Bash Scripts
To simplify the startup process for both the frontend and backend, you can use the provided bash script:

- **Start the Application:**
    Use the bash script `start_linux_macOs.sh` located in the `scripts/bash` directory. This script will automatically navigate to the appropriate directories, install dependencies, and start both the frontend and backend servers in separate terminal windows.
    ```bash
    bash start_linux_macOs.sh
    ```
